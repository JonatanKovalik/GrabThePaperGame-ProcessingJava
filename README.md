## üìú Project Overview

GrabThePaperGame is an arcade-style game developed using the Processing framework with Java. This project demonstrates various game development concepts including dynamic level generation, robust score tracking, an interactive in-game shop, and a system for unlocking achievements. It also features dynamic music logic that adapts to gameplay.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Multi-Level Gameplay:** Progress through increasingly challenging levels.
* **Score System:** Track and display player scores.
* **In-Game Shop:** Purchase upgrades or items using earned currency.
* **Achievements:** Unlock in-game accomplishments.
* **Dynamic Music:** Background music adapts based on game state.
* **Interactive Elements:** Engaging player interactions within the game environment.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Framework:** Processing (Java)
* **Language:** Java
* **IDE:** Processing IDE / Visual Studio Code (depending on setup)
* **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

## üöÄ How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/JonatanKovalik/GrabThePaperGame-ProcessingJava.git](https://github.com/JonatanKovalik/GrabThePaperGame-ProcessingJava.git)
